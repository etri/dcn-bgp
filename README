NDN is a future internet architecture for the purpose of efficent search and distribution of information by using data name instead of existing IP addresses. 
Since NDN basically has an abstract concept for packet routing and forwarding, 
it is necessary to propagate the routing information about name based prefixes of data.
 
DCN-BGP is free software that manages BGP routing protocol on NDN Networking.

The goal of DCN-BGP is to support the scalability. Basically, NDN should delivery all the data on the network by only utilizing their names.
However, There are countless amounts of data on the Internet to be accomodated all of their names by DCN-BGP.
In order to solve this problem, we propose the use of network name seperated from data name to route unknown networks. 

DCN-BGP is degigned and build based on IP-Based BGP Routing Protocol, which is a inter-domain routing protocol of the current Internet.


Prerequisties

* NFD and its dependencies

Refer to Getting started with NFD(https://named-data.net/doc/NFD/current/INSTALL.htm) for detailed installation and running instruction.

DCN-BGP Installation Instructions

    The file 'configure.ac' (or 'configure.in') is used to create
 'configure' by a program called 'autoconf'.  You need 'configure.ac' if
 you want to change it or regenerate 'configure' using a newer version of
 'autoconf'.

    The simplest way to compile this package is:
   1. 'cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
      './booststrap.sh' to configure the package for your system.

   2. type './configure CC=g++' to configure the package for your system.

      Running 'configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
      some messages telling which features it is checking for.

   3. Type 'make' to compile the package.

   4. Type 'make install' to install the programs and any data files and
      documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
      recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
      user, and only the 'make install' phase executed with root privileges.

Running

> cd /usr/local/etc
> sudo cp dbgpd.conf.sample dbgpd.conf
> sudo cp dbgpd-static.conf.sample dbgpd-static.conf

> mkdir -p /tmp/dbgp
